## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mariyam, a dedicated Machine Learning & AI Engineer with a strong background in Human Resources. After 5 years in HR, I made a successful transition to the tech field, combining my analytical skills with a passion for AI and data science.

I hold an MBA in Information Systems Management and a BSc in Computer Science, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set through continuous learning. My expertise spans across Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and big data technologies.

Here are some highlights of what Iâ€™ve worked on:
 - Virtual Painter: An interactive application developed with OpenCV, where users can draw on a canvas using hand gestures. Check it out on GitHub.
 - Drug Review Analysis: An analysis project to understand user sentiment in drug reviews, employing NLP techniques and machine learning models. Take a look here.
 - Car Price Prediction: A machine learning model to predict car prices, leveraging data cleaning, exploration, and Random Forest Regressor. You can find it here.

I'm passionate about building AI-driven solutions that make a real impact. Whether it's through predictive modeling, sentiment analysis, or real-time data processing, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and create innovative solutions.

Feel free to explore my portfolio for more insights into my work!
